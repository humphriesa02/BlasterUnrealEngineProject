# BlasterUnrealEngine
This is a game made from a Udemy course. It is not intended to be sold, nor am I claiming it as my own. I am posting this here mainly as proof of success in taking the course, and in case this demo goes beyond what the course is covering.

Blaster is a third-person online multiplayer shooter made in Unreal Engine 5. It can be played using Steam as the multiplayer connector (so ensure you are running Steam when you play the game). It can be played as a Free-For-All, Team Deathmatch, or Capture the Flag currently.

All credit goes to Stephen Ulibarri for the course, the link to him on Udemy is here:
